### Approach:
#### Below is the approach that we are going to follow.
1.	We will collect data on various factors that can affect life expectancy such as age, gender, lifestyle, health conditions, environmental factors, etc. We will use publicly available datasets from reliable sources like WHO, CDC, etc.
2.	Once we have the data, we will preprocess it by removing any missing or duplicate values, correcting errors, and converting the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3.	We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the preprocessed data to gain insights and identify any patterns or correlations between the variables. We will use various visualization techniques like scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, etc. to analyze the data.
4.	Based on the results of EDA, we will select the most relevant features that are highly correlated with life expectancy. We will use techniques like correlation matrix, feature importance ranking, etc. to identify the important features.
5.	We will evaluate various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc. to identify the best model for our problem. We will use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model.
6.	Once we have selected the best model, we will train it on the preprocessed data. We will use techniques like regularization, hyperparameter tuning, etc. to improve the performance of the model.
7.	We will evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics like mean squared error, R-squared score, etc. We will use test data to evaluate the model and ensure that it generalizes well.
8.	Once we have a trained and evaluated model, we will deploy it in a production environment. We can create a web-based interface where users can input their details and get their predicted life expectancy. We will use cloud-based services like AWS, Google Cloud, etc. to deploy the model.
Throughout the project, we will be using Python and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc. to implement the machine learning algorithms and perform data analysis. We will also be using Jupyter Notebook to document our progress and share our work with the team.
